# Why Can't You Deploy a Container Directly in Kubernetes?

# ✅ Key Reasons

1️⃣ Pods provide abstraction – Pods wrap containers and handle networking, storage, and lifecycle.

2️⃣ Multi-container support – Pods allow multiple containers to share resources.

3️⃣ Scaling & orchestration – Kubernetes manages and scales Pods, not individual containers.

4️⃣ Standard deployment model – Everything in Kubernetes is managed as a Pod for consistency.

💡 Even for a single container, you must wrap it inside a Pod.
